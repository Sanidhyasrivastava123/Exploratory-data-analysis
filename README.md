# Exploratory-data-analysis
**Exploratory Data Analysis** refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.


In this notebook, I have done the **Exploratory Data Analysis** of the famous **Iris dataset** and tried to gain useful insights from the data.
The features present in the dataset are:
1. Sepal Width
2. Sepal Length
3. Petal Width
4. Petal Length

For this EDA, I have used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** libraries.

**Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**Seaborn** is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
